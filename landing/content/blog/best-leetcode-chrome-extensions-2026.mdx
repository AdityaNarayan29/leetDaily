If you are preparing for coding interviews, LeetCode is probably already part of your daily routine. But the default LeetCode experience leaves a lot to be desired — no streak tracking, no smart reminders, and company tags locked behind a paywall.

That is where **Chrome extensions** come in. The right extension can turn LeetCode from a simple problem-solving platform into a complete interview preparation system.

After testing dozens of LeetCode Chrome extensions, here are the **8 best ones you should install in 2026** — whether you want streak tracking, free company tags, AI assistance, or GitHub integration.

## 1. LeetDaily — Daily Challenge Reminder & Streak Tracker

**Best for:** Daily consistency, streak tracking, and company tags

[LeetDaily](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetdaily/kpmmlpoonleloofchbbfnmicchmhehcf) is a free Chrome extension built specifically around the LeetCode daily challenge. If your goal is to build and maintain a daily solving habit, this is the most complete tool available.

**Key features:**

- **Streak tracking** with milestone celebrations — track your current streak and longest streak with visual badges
- **30-day heatmap** showing your daily activity at a glance, similar to GitHub contribution graphs
- **Company tags** for every problem — see which FAANG and top tech companies have asked each question, without needing LeetCode Premium
- **Smart reminders** — get Chrome notifications if you have not solved today's problem, with customizable timing
- **Profile sync** — automatically syncs your LeetCode profile data
- **Yesterday's problem** — quick access to catch up if you missed a day
- **Topic tags** — filter and discover problems by algorithm pattern (DP, graphs, trees, etc.)

What sets LeetDaily apart is its focus on the **daily challenge workflow**. Rather than trying to do everything, it makes the specific habit of solving one problem per day as frictionless as possible. The combination of streak tracking, smart reminders, and free company tags means you get the core features that LeetCode Premium charges for — completely free.

**Price:** Free
**Install:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetdaily/kpmmlpoonleloofchbbfnmicchmhehcf)

## 2. LeetHub v2 — Auto-Sync Solutions to GitHub

**Best for:** Building a public code portfolio

[LeetHub v2](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leethub-v2/mhanfgfagplhgemhjfeolkkdidbakocm) automatically pushes your accepted LeetCode solutions to a GitHub repository. Every time you submit a correct solution, it creates a commit with the problem name, your code, and metadata.

**Key features:**

- Automatic GitHub commits on accepted submissions
- Organized folder structure by problem number and title
- Supports multiple languages
- Shows your coding activity on your GitHub contribution graph

This is essential if you want to showcase your problem-solving skills to recruiters. A GitHub repo with hundreds of organized LeetCode solutions is a strong signal during job applications.

**Price:** Free
**Install:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leethub-v2/mhanfgfagplhgemhjfeolkkdidbakocm)

## 3. LeetCopilot — AI-Powered Hints & Mock Interviews

**Best for:** Learning from hints without seeing the full solution

[LeetCopilot](https://leetcopilot.dev/) uses AI to provide progressive hints when you are stuck on a problem. Instead of jumping straight to the solution (which kills the learning process), you get nudges that guide your thinking.

**Key features:**

- AI-generated progressive hints (from subtle to explicit)
- Mock interview simulation with timer
- Study notes and bookmarking
- Problem difficulty insights

The hint system is genuinely useful for learning. When you are stuck on a medium or hard problem, getting a directional hint ("consider using a monotonic stack") is far more valuable than reading a full editorial.

**Price:** Free tier available, paid plans for unlimited hints
**Install:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetcopilot/afjcmkbakjjongaliahofkgpelllhpgo)

## 4. BetterLC — Unlock Company Tags for Free

**Best for:** Targeted company interview preparation

[BetterLC](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/betterlc-unlock-leetcode/debbebdlpbnpnnicofdpociejpmokdnm) focuses on one thing and does it well — showing company tags on LeetCode problems without requiring a Premium subscription.

**Key features:**

- Unlocks company tags on problem pages
- Shows frequency data (how often a company asks each problem)
- Filter problems by company
- Works alongside the native LeetCode interface

If your primary reason for considering LeetCode Premium is company tags, BetterLC is a free alternative worth trying. Note that LeetDaily also includes company tags alongside its streak tracking features, so you might not need both.

**Price:** Free
**Install:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/betterlc-unlock-leetcode/debbebdlpbnpnnicofdpociejpmokdnm)

## 5. CrackTech — Company-Based Problem Lists

**Best for:** Systematic company-targeted preparation

[CrackTech](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cracktech-leetcode-compan/fmbicfmfmangckllfaomfkhdankgapfk) takes company-based preparation a step further by organizing problems into structured lists based on which companies ask them and how recently.

**Key features:**

- Curated problem lists organized by company
- Frequency and recency data
- DSA topic categorization
- Interview preparation roadmaps

Where BetterLC shows tags on individual problems, CrackTech gives you complete study plans for specific companies. Useful if you have a target company and want a structured approach.

**Price:** Free
**Install:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cracktech-leetcode-compan/fmbicfmfmangckllfaomfkhdankgapfk)

## 6. LeetStreak — Visual Streak Tracking

**Best for:** Social accountability and streak visualization

[LeetStreak](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetstreak/dnbopnpokfaaekbbfcmbldgepehngbel) focuses on streak visualization and social features, including Discord integration for sharing your progress with study groups.

**Key features:**

- Visual streak counter
- Discord sharing integration
- Daily completion tracking
- Streak milestones

If you are part of a Discord study group, the sharing feature can add social accountability to your practice routine. For standalone streak tracking with more features (heatmap, company tags, reminders), LeetDaily is the more complete option.

**Price:** Free
**Install:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetstreak/dnbopnpokfaaekbbfcmbldgepehngbel)

## 7. Daily-Challenge Reminder — Simple Notifications

**Best for:** Minimalists who just want a reminder

[Daily-Challenge Reminder](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/daily-challenge-reminder/fgpphonilhabeglmgpbabbnamimmbihf) is a lightweight extension that does exactly one thing — reminds you to complete the LeetCode daily challenge.

**Key features:**

- Chrome notification reminders
- Customizable reminder times
- Minimal resource usage

If you do not want streak tracking, heatmaps, or company tags and just need a simple daily nudge, this is the lightest option. For a more feature-rich reminder system with streak context, LeetDaily includes smart reminders alongside its other features.

**Price:** Free
**Install:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/daily-challenge-reminder/fgpphonilhabeglmgpbabbnamimmbihf)

## 8. LeetTrack — AI-Powered Progress Tracker

**Best for:** Data-driven preparation with AI insights

[LeetTrack](https://www.leettrack.dev/) combines progress tracking with AI-generated feedback on your solving patterns and areas for improvement.

**Key features:**

- AI-powered study notes
- Progress tracking across topics
- Weakness identification
- Personalized study recommendations

LeetTrack is newer but promising. The AI feedback on your solving patterns can help identify blind spots — for example, if you consistently struggle with graph problems, it will surface that pattern.

**Price:** Free tier available
**Install:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leettrack/pfjnciclnfalhagdkgpobdaloebfjjic)
