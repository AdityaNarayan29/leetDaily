If you are preparing for coding interviews, LeetCode is probably already part of your daily routine. But the default LeetCode experience leaves a lot to be desired — no streak tracking, no smart reminders, and company tags locked behind a paywall.

That is where **Chrome extensions** come in. The right extension can turn LeetCode from a simple problem-solving platform into a complete interview preparation system.

After testing dozens of LeetCode Chrome extensions, here are the **8 best ones you should install in 2026** — whether you want streak tracking, free company tags, AI assistance, or GitHub integration.

## 1. LeetDaily — The All-in-One LeetCode Companion

**Best for:** Daily consistency, curated list tracking, company tags, and structured interview prep

[LeetDaily](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetdaily/kpmmlpoonleloofchbbfnmicchmhehcf) is a free Chrome extension that turns LeetCode into a complete interview preparation system. It goes far beyond a simple daily challenge reminder — it tracks your progress across curated study lists, gives you a full problems explorer, and lets you customize what counts toward your streak.

**Key features:**

- **Curated study list tracking** — track your progress across Blind 75, NeetCode 150, and LeetCode 75 with live progress bars and one-click "next unsolved" navigation
- **Problems Explorer** — a full-page browser for 2000+ LeetCode problems with filters for difficulty, topics, companies, and curated lists, with sortable columns and company frequency data
- **Streak tracking** with milestone celebrations at 7, 14, 30, 50, 100, and 365 days — plus a streak detail modal showing your last 7 days, longest streak, and progress to next milestone
- **Flexible streak rules** — choose what counts toward your streak: daily challenge, curated lists, topic/company problems, or any submission
- **30-day heatmap** showing your daily activity at a glance, similar to GitHub contribution graphs
- **Company tags** for every problem — see which FAANG and top tech companies have asked each question with frequency counts, without needing LeetCode Premium
- **Topic & company progress** — track solved/total for your target topics and companies, with intersection views showing problems that match both
- **Smart reminders** — daily Chrome notifications at your chosen time, plus an urgent "streak at risk" alert 2 hours before midnight reset
- **Data export & import** — backup and restore all your progress as JSON
- **Profile sync** — automatically syncs your solved problem IDs from your LeetCode account

What sets LeetDaily apart is that it combines **daily consistency tools** (streak tracking, reminders, heatmap) with **structured preparation** (Blind 75/NeetCode 150/LC 75 tracking, problems explorer, company tags). Most other extensions focus on just one of these — LeetDaily covers both, completely free, with all data stored locally for privacy.

**Price:** Free
**Install:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetdaily/kpmmlpoonleloofchbbfnmicchmhehcf)

## 2. LeetHub v2 — Auto-Sync Solutions to GitHub

**Best for:** Building a public code portfolio

[LeetHub v2](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leethub-v2/mhanfgfagplhgemhjfeolkkdidbakocm) automatically pushes your accepted LeetCode solutions to a GitHub repository. Every time you submit a correct solution, it creates a commit with the problem name, your code, and metadata.

**Key features:**

- Automatic GitHub commits on accepted submissions
- Organized folder structure by problem number and title
- Supports multiple languages
- Shows your coding activity on your GitHub contribution graph

This is essential if you want to showcase your problem-solving skills to recruiters. A GitHub repo with hundreds of organized LeetCode solutions is a strong signal during job applications.

**Price:** Free
**Install:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leethub-v2/mhanfgfagplhgemhjfeolkkdidbakocm)

## 3. LeetCopilot — AI-Powered Hints & Mock Interviews

**Best for:** Learning from hints without seeing the full solution

[LeetCopilot](https://leetcopilot.dev/) uses AI to provide progressive hints when you are stuck on a problem. Instead of jumping straight to the solution (which kills the learning process), you get nudges that guide your thinking.

**Key features:**

- AI-generated progressive hints (from subtle to explicit)
- Mock interview simulation with timer
- Study notes and bookmarking
- Problem difficulty insights

The hint system is genuinely useful for learning. When you are stuck on a medium or hard problem, getting a directional hint ("consider using a monotonic stack") is far more valuable than reading a full editorial.

**Price:** Free tier available, paid plans for unlimited hints
**Install:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetcopilot/afjcmkbakjjongaliahofkgpelllhpgo)

## 4. BetterLC — Unlock Company Tags for Free

**Best for:** Targeted company interview preparation

[BetterLC](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/betterlc-unlock-leetcode/debbebdlpbnpnnicofdpociejpmokdnm) focuses on one thing and does it well — showing company tags on LeetCode problems without requiring a Premium subscription.

**Key features:**

- Unlocks company tags on problem pages
- Shows frequency data (how often a company asks each problem)
- Filter problems by company
- Works alongside the native LeetCode interface

If your primary reason for considering LeetCode Premium is company tags, BetterLC is a free alternative worth trying. Note that LeetDaily also includes company tags alongside its streak tracking features, so you might not need both.

**Price:** Free
**Install:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/betterlc-unlock-leetcode/debbebdlpbnpnnicofdpociejpmokdnm)

## 5. CrackTech — Company-Based Problem Lists

**Best for:** Systematic company-targeted preparation

[CrackTech](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cracktech-leetcode-compan/fmbicfmfmangckllfaomfkhdankgapfk) takes company-based preparation a step further by organizing problems into structured lists based on which companies ask them and how recently.

**Key features:**

- Curated problem lists organized by company
- Frequency and recency data
- DSA topic categorization
- Interview preparation roadmaps

Where BetterLC shows tags on individual problems, CrackTech gives you complete study plans for specific companies. Useful if you have a target company and want a structured approach.

**Price:** Free
**Install:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cracktech-leetcode-compan/fmbicfmfmangckllfaomfkhdankgapfk)

## 6. LeetStreak — Visual Streak Tracking

**Best for:** Social accountability and streak visualization

[LeetStreak](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetstreak/dnbopnpokfaaekbbfcmbldgepehngbel) focuses on streak visualization and social features, including Discord integration for sharing your progress with study groups.

**Key features:**

- Visual streak counter
- Discord sharing integration
- Daily completion tracking
- Streak milestones

If you are part of a Discord study group, the sharing feature can add social accountability to your practice routine. For standalone streak tracking with more features (heatmap, company tags, reminders), LeetDaily is the more complete option.

**Price:** Free
**Install:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetstreak/dnbopnpokfaaekbbfcmbldgepehngbel)

## 7. Daily-Challenge Reminder — Simple Notifications

**Best for:** Minimalists who just want a reminder

[Daily-Challenge Reminder](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/daily-challenge-reminder/fgpphonilhabeglmgpbabbnamimmbihf) is a lightweight extension that does exactly one thing — reminds you to complete the LeetCode daily challenge.

**Key features:**

- Chrome notification reminders
- Customizable reminder times
- Minimal resource usage

If you do not want streak tracking, heatmaps, or company tags and just need a simple daily nudge, this is the lightest option. For a more feature-rich reminder system with streak context, LeetDaily includes smart reminders alongside its other features.

**Price:** Free
**Install:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/daily-challenge-reminder/fgpphonilhabeglmgpbabbnamimmbihf)

## 8. LeetTrack — AI-Powered Progress Tracker

**Best for:** Data-driven preparation with AI insights

[LeetTrack](https://www.leettrack.dev/) combines progress tracking with AI-generated feedback on your solving patterns and areas for improvement.

**Key features:**

- AI-powered study notes
- Progress tracking across topics
- Weakness identification
- Personalized study recommendations

LeetTrack is newer but promising. The AI feedback on your solving patterns can help identify blind spots — for example, if you consistently struggle with graph problems, it will surface that pattern.

**Price:** Free tier available
**Install:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leettrack/pfjnciclnfalhagdkgpobdaloebfjjic)
